# PyBer Analaysis

Analysis of rideshare data using Matplotlib

## Overview of Project 

Matplotlib was used to complete an analysis of data and create visualizations of the data for PyBer, a ridesharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. The analysis was completed on data provided from two excel file by PyBer. [city_data.csv]( https://github.com/AjaniBenoit/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/city_data.csv) and [ride_data.csv]( https://github.com/AjaniBenoit/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/ride_data.csv). Analysis of the data files primarily focused on an exploratory analysis of the data 

### Purpose 

The purpose of this report is to provide a summary of the findings from the exploratory analysis of the data.

## Results 

The ride data and city data dataset were merged into one dataset using the Pandas merge function. The groupby() function was then used to calculate the total rides by city type; totoal drivers for each city type; the total amount of fares for each city type; the average fare per ride for each city type; and the average fare per driver for each city type. A new data frame was created to summarize the data.
